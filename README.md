GAME LOGIC

# Description 

The purpose of the game is to make as much money as possible in 30 days by trading crypto coins and NFTs, but there are other ways to make money too, which I detail below in the section marked How to Make Money. Each turn is equivalent to 1 day; so you have 30 turns. In this instance, we will create a single player game. Player starts with a health rating of 100%. 

The premise is that you are a crypto entrepreneur and you start off with 20000 USD, a hardware wallet that holds 1000 crypto coins and no weapons. You started the game with a debt owed to your TradFi bank, Wells Fargo, of 50000 USD and they charge interest on that amount (1000 USD per day). Each day, you bridge from one trading venue to another, until you finally end up in Wells Fargo.

Those shitcoins the player launched are coming back to haunt him too, in ways we will find out about later. 

# Coin Availability and pricing

At each trading venue a variety of coins is available for sale, with prices that fluctuate from location to location. The full set of possible coins you can buy is below in the section marked Coins and NFTs. Not every coin is available for purchase at every location. There is an element of randomness to their availability. In general, however, the price of a coin will not fluctuate more than 50% from one turn to the next. 

Coin pricing is affected by normal gentle fluctuations, which are randomised. In the 10% of cases where a special event has not occurred (see further below on special events), ordinary gentle fluctuations occur. 

# Special Events

 But certain special events have a greater impact on pricing. These include: 

- China bans crypto! (This causes prices to fluctuate in the following ways: coins  tend to increase in price by 3-17% NFTs increase by around 20%); 
- SEC clamping down on DeFi with tough new registration rules! (This causes coin and FNT prices to be lower than expected); 
- Binance got hacked! (This causes the price of Bitcoin and Ether to fall 25% Whereas the prices of other coins and NFTs fall between 15 and 50%)
- “1. What” (This event is printed as displayed here and causes no change beyond the normal gentle fluctuations in prices) 
- Jim Cramer announces that Bitcoin is in retirement portfolio and shouts Buy! Buy! Buy!  (this leads to prices tumbling accrued the board 5-35%)
- Jim Cramer announces that he has sold all his crypto! (This cause prices to rise 25-85%)
- “Cardano releases yet another academic paper!” (No change beyond the norm)
- “Roaring Kitty tweets a picture of himself on the toilet!” (This causes a modest increases in prices)
- “Gensler suggests on Twitter that ETH is a commodity. Later he clarifies his remarks!” (This causes the price of ETH to tumble 15% beyond what it normally would). 
* “Your wife's boyfriend offers you a ride in his Lambo this morning!” (This cause prices of NFTs all to fall to 10% of what they were worth when they first appeared) 
* “Peter Schiff appears on CNBC and shouts for a full hour about why Bitcoin sucks!” (This causes a 5-10% decrease in prices)
* “Vitalik clarifies it’s 9.5 inches!” (This causes the prices of Shiba Inu, HEX,, Dogecoin  and Floki Inu to skyrocket 400-500%)
* “The parabola just broke!” (The market  tumbles around 15-20%)
* “Gary Vee is out there grinding every day, making it, doing it, creating new realities. Living, which is not the same as being. Think about it. He’s out there pumping bags bro. For real bruh” (this causes all prices to increase massively - about 50-250% but the effect is short-lived and prices return to their norm the following move) 

These special events happen in 90% of turns. When they do, player is informed at the start of the turn about their occurrence and their general effect on the market. That general effect is simply summarised as “Bullish!” Or “Bearish!” For example:

“Jim Cramer announced this morning that he bought Bitcoin. Bearish!”

(Ensure that exclamation marks are included each time)

However, of all the special events, there is one that is by far the most consequential; namely, an SEC investigation. These are dealt with below. 

# SEC investigations

Special events are equally likely to occur. However, as you make more money, the likelihood of an SEC investigation ratchets up. It should not occur too often, but more often as you make more money.

In this special event, named “The SEC are investigating you for promoting unregistered securities!” You will meet Commissioner Smartass and a random number between 1-5 Deputies. You must then decide what to do. If you don’t have any lawyers, you must answer Y (yes) or N (no) to the question "Do you run?" If you are lucky, you'll get away - otherwise, the SEC will subpoena you. The more deputies accompanying Commission Smartass, the worse the effect of the subpoena will be on your Health. Effect is as follows:

a. Commissioner Smartass alone - 15% drop in health
b. Commissioner Smartass and 1 deputy - 25% drop
c. Commissioner Smartass and 2 deputies - 35% drop
d. Commissioner Smartass and 3 deputies - 45% drop
e. Commissioner Smartass and 4 deputies - 65% drop
f. Commissioner Smartass and 5 deputies - 85% drop

If, on the other hand, you have acquired one or more lawyers, you can either run ("R" key) or fight ("F"). Lawyers may be offered to you at bargain prices randomly through the game (they cost random amounts between 2000 and 6000 USD each). Or you can buy or sell them at Curve or eToro levels. When entering those levels, the player will be presented with the opportunity to enter the law firm to buy or sell a lawyer. The cost of buying / selling will be 5000 in the law firm. 

To beat the SEC by fighting them, you sue all the deputies, one by one, and then finally Commissioner Smartass. Bear in mind that the more lawyers you have, the more damage you will do to the SEC! If you win against Commissioner Smartass in a lawsuit, you can recover legal costs and compensationfrom him . If you are lucky, a psychologist will offer to “heal “you (i.e. restore your health to 100) for a price which is between 1000 and 3500.

If, after killing Commissioner Smartass, you are unlucky enough to meet the SEC again later on, they will be lead by his replacement, Commissioner Bob, who is tougher. If you then successfully sue him too, you'll meet still tougher opposition in future - so it's often wise to run from the cops!

Some locations are more susceptible to having the SEC in them than others. You can select, Claude. 

If you are unlucky enough to die from SEC investigations, then you lose the game at that point, no matter how much money you have acquired. 

# NFT availability and pricing 

NFTs are generally less available to buy than coins. However, they have the potential to swing wildly in price very quickly. They can increase to the upside by up to 3-fold in the course of 3-7 moves. But they can also dip between 50% and 90% from one move to the next. In 30% of cases, however, their price is relatively stable, fluctuating no more than 5-10% between turns. 

# noopp

In 20% of cases, where a player buys a given NFT, it will not be available for sale at any point thereafter (hereafter called the “noopp” scenario). 

# 80subset

In the remaining 80% of cases (hereafter referred to as the “80subset”), he will have at least one opportunity to sell, but no more than three for the rest of the game. 

# 1opp

In 45% of cases in the 80subset,  there is only one opportunity to sell the NFT (hereafter called “only1opp”). In 50% of cases the 1opp should be priced lower than the purchase price. In 15% of cases it should be the same as the purchase price. And in the remaining 35% of 1opp cases, it should be priced higher than the purchase price. In any 1opp case, the NFT should never be priced higher than 50% of the purchase price. 

# 2opp

In 35% of cases in the 80subset, there are two opportunities to sell the NFT (hereafter called “2opp”). In 50% of 2opp cases, the first opportunity to sell (hereafter called “1stin2opp”) should see the NFT priced lower than the purchase price. In 15% of 1stin2opp cases it should be the same as the purchase price. And in the remaining 35% of 1stin2opp cases, it should be priced higher than the purchase price. 

In 50% of cases, the second opportunity to sell (hereafter called “2ndin2opp”) should see the NFT priced lower than the purchase price. In 15% of 2ndin2opp cases it should be the same as the purchase price. And in the remaining 35% of 2ndin2opp cases, it should be priced between 200 and 500% higher than the purchase price. 

3opp

In 20% of cases in the 80subset, there are three opportunities to sell the NFT (hereafter called “3opp”). 

In 50% of 3opp cases, the first opportunity to sell (hereafter called “1stin3opp”) should see the NFT priced lower than the purchase price. In 15% of 1stin3opp cases it should be the same as the purchase price. And in the remaining 35% of 1stin3opp cases, it should be priced higher than the purchase price. 

In 50% of cases, the second opportunity to sell (hereafter called “2ndin3opp”) should see the NFT priced lower than the purchase price. In 15% of 2ndin3opp cases it should be the same as the purchase price. And in the remaining 35% of 2ndin3opp cases, it should be priced higher than the purchase price. 

In 69% of cases, the thrid opportunity to sell (hereafter called “3rdin3opp”) should see the NFT priced 10-25% lower than the purchase price. In 5% of 3rdin3opp cases it should be priced 700% of the purchase price. And in the remaining 26% of 3rdin3opp cases, it should be priced 100-200% higher than the purchase price. 

# Randomness 

Where randomness is called for, calibrate it so that the player does not get too discouraged, but still faces a challenge in completing the game with the debt paid off. It should be hard to finish successfully, in that sense, but not impossible. 

# How to Make Money

The main way to make money is by buying coins at one location and selling them at another location for a higher price. When a player arrives at a new trading venue, he is told which 

# Liquidity 

Assume that, whenever the player wants to sell his coins, they will generally be “bought” and converted for USD at the prevailing rate for the trading venue. However, in a small number of cases, there will be insufficient liquidity, meaning that the player will try to sell his coins, but will only be able to sell a certain number of them. The player will be met with a message indicating “Insufficient liquidity”.

In the case of coins, the player will encounter insufficient liquidity in 5-10% of cases. The player will almost always be able to sell at least 75% of his holdings. But in a small number of cases, he will only be able to sell 65% of his coins on a given turn. 

In the case of NFTs, insufficient liquidity will arise in 25%-65% of cases. But where there is liquidity, the player will be able to sell all of his NFTs.

# ACtions

# Buying

A pop up menu is displayed at the start of each turn informing the player which coins and NFTs (plus their parenthetically displayed corresponding keys) there are to buy and their prices. Liquidity is never displayed in the case of buying, 

To buy, the player must press the “B” on his keyboard, followed by the letter of the coin or NFT he wishes to buy, followed by the quantity in integers. At each stage, he is promoted by an on-screen message requesting an input.

Once the buy process is complete, the appropriate amount of funds is deducted from his balance and he transfers the coins or NFTs to his cold storage wallet. 

He may not have enough room in his wallet to buy coins or NFTs. 

# SElling

Selling drugs is similar and is represented by the S key. However, Liquidity is not displayed until an irreversible decision to sell coins has been made. The point of irreversibility is reached once the player enters the desired amount of coins to sell and presses a sell button. At the point, he will be informed of the liquidity position and the appropriate deduction and credits will be made. 

# New Turn

When the player is finished and wants to move to the next location, he presses “J” for “Jet”. 

# Tornado Cash 

If he does not have enough room in his wallet to buy the desired number of coins, he can press “T” followed by the letter of the coin or NFT he wishes to send to Tornado Cash to a trusted friend, followed by the quantity, then he presses Go. This will remove the identified coins and NFTs, making room for him to buy in this turn. 

However, using Tornado Cash increases the chances of the cops red flagging your address and the DoJ may arrest you. If they arrest you, you will need to pay between 500 and 3000 for bail. Bail gets you out of jail and the game proceeds as before. 

Using Tornado cash carries a random risk of triggering a DoJ arrest of between 24 and 40%

At the end of the game, a random percentage between 0 and 100 of the funds sent via tornado cash are returned to you and counted alongside your final balance. A message pops up on screen to indicate what percentage that is. 

# Bank

During his turn the player may opt to put his USD into a Bank, where it will earn interest at 2.15% per day compounding. The player banks money in this way by pressing “K” and then entering the quantity of USD his wishes to save, then pressing Go. He can also withdraw money from his bank. However, it takes one turn for the money to get withdrawn. So, for example, if he withdraws on day 5, the money will only be available on day 6. 

Money in the bank is protected from theft and hacks. *** but not SEC fines??? ***

# Finances - Loans and Banks

The interest that accrues each day in relation to your 50000 USD debt is added to the debt at the end of the game and counts against the player’s total money. Player’s total money consists of the USD value of all coins and NFTs you own at the end of the game; the Toal USD you have in your possession; and the total USD you have In your bank, including any interest that money has accrued. It is possible to have a negative balance at the end of the game. The combined net worth of the player is entirely liquid at the conclusion of the game, meaning that if the player owes Wells Fargo X, whereas his liquid USD is X minus 3, but the combine value of his liquid USD, coins, NFTs and savings is or exceeds X, then he is able to pay off his debt in full. 

After the interest has been calculated and deducted as described, the player is prompted to visit Wells Fargo to pay his debt. Player must respond by pressing the “Y” key and is prompted to do so. Player is then asked how much money to pay to Wells Fargo and enters the amount owed in integers. 

The player’s total money, minus the amount he pays in debts and interest represents his score.  

The player is presented with a pop up message at the end of the game indicating his score. There are some cool visuals to accompany this that either celebrate a good score or commiserate a poor one or a loss.
